    label: 'Pluto',
    content: 'Pluto is the ninth planet in the Solar System. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon, and one-third its volume.'

    label: 'Mars',
    content: 'Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth\'s sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System\'s planets.'

    label: 'Neptune',
    content: 'Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth. Compared to Uranus, its neighbouring ice giant, Neptune is slightly more massive, but denser and smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface, and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years.'

    label: 'Jupiter',
    content: 'Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun.'

    label: 'Venus',
    content: 'Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. '

    label: 'Eris',
    content: 'Eris is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. It is a trans-Neptunian object in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory based team and verified later that year. It was named in September 2006 after the Greco Roman goddess of strife and discord. Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun and the sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (counting moons).'

    label: 'Earth',
    content: 'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth\'s water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth\'s crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth\'s crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth\'s land hemisphere.'

    label: 'Saturn',
    content: 'Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its mass.'

    label: 'Mercury',
    content: 'Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years.'

    label: 'Uranus',
    content: 'Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet\'s atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System\'s planets.'
