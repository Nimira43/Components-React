    <h1 className='p-5 bg-light text-2xl'>Formula 1</h1>
    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Formula 1, often abbreviated as F1, is widely regarded as the pinnacle of global motorsport, combining extreme engineering, elite athletic performance, and a worldwide cultural footprint unmatched by any other form of racing. Governed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), Formula 1 has existed in its modern championship form since 1950, evolving from earlier European racing series into a tightly regulated, technologically advanced competition that spans continents and captivates millions of fans every season. The term “Formula” refers to the strict set of rules that all teams and cars must follow, ensuring that while innovation thrives, competition remains fair and structured.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      At its core, Formula 1 is a championship composed of a series of races known as Grands Prix, held on circuits across the world — from purpose-built tracks like Silverstone and Suzuka to dramatic street circuits such as Monaco and Singapore. Each race awards points to drivers and teams based on finishing positions, contributing to two parallel championships: the Drivers' Championship, which crowns the season's top driver, and the Constructors' Championship, which rewards the most successful team. This dual-championship structure is one of the sport's defining features, emphasising both individual brilliance and collective engineering mastery.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      The cars themselves are among the most advanced machines ever built for racing. Formula 1 cars are open-wheel, single-seat vehicles designed for maximum aerodynamic efficiency and extraordinary speed. They are capable of generating immense downforce through wings, underbody tunnels, and airflow-sculpting bodywork, allowing them to corner at speeds that exert extreme g-forces on the driver. Modern F1 cars also rely heavily on hybrid power units that combine internal combustion engines with sophisticated energy-recovery systems, making them some of the most efficient engines in the world. Every component — from suspension geometry to tyre compounds — is engineered to operate at the absolute limit of performance.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Drivers in Formula 1 represent the absolute elite of global motorsport. Only 20 drivers compete in a given season, each required to hold a prestigious FIA Super Licence, the highest level of racing certification available. These athletes endure extreme physical and mental demands: cockpit temperatures can exceed 50°C, g-forces can reach levels comparable to fighter jets, and split-second decision-making is essential at speeds approaching 370 km/h. The combination of reflexes, endurance, racecraft, and psychological resilience makes F1 drivers some of the most specialised competitors in any sport.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Teams, known officially as constructors, form the backbone of Formula 1. Each constructor designs and builds its own car according to the regulations, creating a unique blend of engineering philosophy, innovation, and strategic approach. The sport currently features 11 teams, including iconic names like Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, and Red Bull Racing. Many teams are based in the United Kingdom, which has become the technical hub of Formula 1, hosting factories, wind tunnels, and research centers that drive the sport's relentless technological evolution. The competition between teams is as fierce as the rivalry between drivers, with engineering breakthroughs often determining championship outcomes.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      A typical Formula 1 weekend is structured around several key sessions: practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Practice sessions allow teams to test setups, gather data, and adapt to track conditions. Qualifying determines the starting grid, with drivers pushing their cars to the absolute limit over a single lap. The race, held on Sunday, is a strategic and physical battle involving tyre management, pit stops, fuel strategy, and on-track overtaking. In recent years, the sport has also introduced Sprint events at select races — shorter, high-intensity races that add an additional competitive dimension to the weekend.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Formula 1's history is rich with legendary figures, dramatic rivalries, and technological revolutions. Drivers like Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton, each with seven world titles, have become global icons. Teams such as Ferrari, the most successful constructor with 16 championships, have shaped the sport's identity across decades. The evolution of regulations — from banning electronic driver aids to introducing hybrid engines — has continually reshaped the competitive landscape, ensuring that each era of Formula 1 feels distinct. The sport's narrative is defined by innovation, controversy, triumph, and tragedy, all woven into a global spectacle.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Beyond the racing itself, Formula 1 is a massive commercial and cultural enterprise. The Formula One Group, owned by Liberty Media since 2017, manages the sport's commercial rights and global expansion strategy. With races held across five continents and broadcast to hundreds of millions of viewers, F1 has become a worldwide entertainment phenomenon. The sport's financial scale is enormous: running a competitive team can cost hundreds of millions of pounds per year, though recent cost-cap regulations aim to level the playing field and ensure long-term sustainability. Sponsorships, hospitality, merchandise, and digital content all contribute to the sport's economic ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light' >
      In recent years, Formula 1 has also embraced a forward-looking approach to sustainability and technological relevance. The sport is committed to achieving Net Carbon Zero by 2030, with initiatives including sustainable fuels, reduced logistical emissions, and more efficient hybrid systems. Many innovations developed in F1 — from safety technologies like the Halo device to energy-efficient power units — have influenced road-car engineering and broader automotive research. This connection between racing and real-world technology reinforces Formula 1's role as a laboratory for high-performance engineering.
    </p>

    <p className='px-5 pb-5 bg-light'>
      Ultimately, Formula 1 endures because it blends speed, strategy, innovation, and human drama into a single, globally resonant spectacle. It is a sport where milliseconds matter, where engineering brilliance meets human courage, and where every season tells a new story shaped by evolving technology, shifting rivalries, and the relentless pursuit of perfection. Whether viewed through the lens of athletic achievement, mechanical artistry, or international entertainment, Formula 1 remains one of the most compelling and influential sporting competitions in the world — a true fusion of science, spectacle, and speed that continues to evolve with each passing year.
